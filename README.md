# Fall2020-Fall2021 Entry Course Surveys Analysis
The purpose of these surveys was in short, to find out the type of people enrolling or not enrolling in these computing courses and why.
Some of the files you can expect are the following:
- The "surveydata" folder contains 4 .csv files which pertain to the 4 individual surveys that were conducted.
- "Spreadsheet Analysis.md" contains a single link that directly sends the user to the edited "surveydata" .csv's in which the analysis took place
- "Spreadsheet Analysis Results.pdf" displays a record of which classes were surveyed including all 4 datasets, along with how many students recorded answers in those classes, respectively. It also includes those classes' demographic data.
